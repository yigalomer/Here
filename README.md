Background :

Once the passenger entered his pickup and destination locations, your app displays a list of available taxis, along with the Cab Station name and icon, sorted by ETA.
Your mission, should you choose to accept itâ€‹, is to create a page with the taxis listed. Use stub data for the taxis list, no external APIs is required to use. The list should be refreshed every 5 seconds with updated ETAs that change randomly.
